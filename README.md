# Choice Sets Size One

This is the repository for the "Choice Sets of Size One" project.  Please store all code here so it is accessible to all members.

 ## Simulations

The simulation files are contained in the Simulation Directory.  To run the files source the PowerExploration.R file.  You 
will be asked to select a simulation scenario for three different options.  You may need to change the seed if you want to 
run a unique simulation.  The final output should be the plot.  The file is currently built to run interactively.  There are
some small changes that need to be made if you want to run the progrma in headless mode.

This would be:

- [ ] Disable the Menu by hardcoding the scenario choice or passing it in the command line
- [ ] Save the graph and data to a file rather than placing it in the environment
